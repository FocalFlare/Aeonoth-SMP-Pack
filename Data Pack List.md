# Data Pack List
Below is a list of data packs that are used. Usually I'd load these data packs as mods via Paxiâ€”a data pack loader mod, but at the moment I'm loading them as data packs for the world.

Because these are not mods, they are neither required by the server nor optional to have, so they'll only load upon the host entering the world.
