# Aeonoth-SMP-Pack
Random hand-picked mods used for the Aeonoth 1.18.2 SMP

---

This mod pack has [almost] all of the mods that I am currently using for the Aeonoth Discord SMP (link below for that). As I'm not considering this as "final", there _will_ be erratic changes to the pack, such as adding and removing mods. I may open a GitHub repository for gathering issues revolving around mod interactions, such as incorrect behaviors or crashes (in-game or at launch), but I advise that you post these issues you experience with such mods to their **original developers** so that they know about it.

This isn't really meant to be a "quest-based" mod pack, as I have no idea how to properly set up a "storyline" or a "progression" for it like everyone does, but you are free to still use this pack for your own playthrough. There is also no specific theme or "prompt" with these mods. It's just based on what I think should be in the server.

**_Credit goes to the original creators of all included mods in this pack. Make sure you go check them out!_**

# Installation
To install this mod pack as a file,

## [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/download-modpacks/)
1. Right-click anywhere within the instance menu and select "Create Instance".
2. Select Import and click "Browse".
3. Locate the supported mod pack file. You can import from any ZIP file and/or a Modrinth mod pack (MRPACK) file.
4. Click "Open" and then click OK.

## [MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/wiki/Import-Instance)
I assume that the process is the same as Prism.
1. Right-click anywhere within the instance menu and select "Add Instance" or click "Add Instance" at the top left.
2. Select "Import from zip" and click "Browse".
3. Locate the supported mod pack file. You can import from a ZIP file or a Modrinth mod pack (MRPACK) file.
4. Click "Open" and then click OK.

## [CurseForge](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197912-exporting-and-importing-modpacks)
I've never used the CurseForge launcher for Minecraft, so some of this may be incorrect.
1. In the "My Modpacks" tab, click "Import".
2. You are given a choice to import via a ZIP file or a 7-day temporary profile code. Select "Choose .zip file".
3. Locate the supported mod pack file. You can import from a CurseForge ZIP mod pack (ZIP) file that matches any of the criteria under "'Invalid file' error"
4. Click "Open".

## [Modrinth](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth)
I've also never used the Modrinth launcher, so sadly, I don't know if or not importing a mod pack from a file is possible. If you know a way, please let me know!

For other launchers, you will have to consult your launcher's docs for installing a mod pack from a file as an instance.

## Disclaimer
### Specific Mods
The mods below have some additional notes to them. Some may be modified to work a bit properly, either in my favor or for my own use cases.
* Framed Blocks: This mod has been modified of its whitelist config to include Chipped's normal and stained glass blocks as a whitelist for every hull frame available. The mod's metadata can't be created as this is slightly modified. **For legal reasons—and for my own safety and yours, I ask you to refrain from publishing this modification on its own anywhere online unless I get permission from the developer(s) of the mod. If you plan on using this mod, please download the original and modify it yourself!**
* e4mc: This mod in Prism is categorized as a server mod, but the only time it's needed by the server is when someone is hosting a world with it. It is not needed by the client. Server hosts must remain in the hosted world for the server to be open.
* Freecam: Yes, a mod like this is usually bannable in most sophisticated servers, but this mod isn't actually a "cheat" and I would not ever include any cheats in a pack for any reason.
* Xaero's World Map & Minimap: For whatever reason, 25.2.6 of Minimap and 1.39.9 of World Map both prevent my game from loading when paired with other mods that I have in my main 1.18.2 instance. So if you're using these versions of these mods with other mods yourself, be mindful of which mods you're using these with.
* Physics Mod: [PRO MEMBERS ONLY!] The ocean physics option—even though Physics Mod is a client-sided mod—may cause you to appear as if you are sporadically moving in every direction when in water. Be cautious if you use this feature in a sophisticated server.

### Override Mods
The mods below are still used by the server, but are removed from the pack themselves (on Modrinth) due to licensing restrictions, as they are not available from Modrinth but rather from CurseForge. You will have to download and install these mods into the instance yourself. More mods from the mod list will be listed here, depending on what I'm told can't be in this pack.
* [Fluid Drawers Legacy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fluid-drawers-legacy): All rights reserved


### Other Mods
In Prism, which is the launcher that I'm using, mods are categorized by the side they load for. You can determine if a mod is optional for (client-side) or required by a server (server-side) by looking at the "Side" column for each mod. If, for whatever reason, this column doesn't show for you:
	1. Right-click on any of the column headers.
	2. Click "side".

### Issues
If any issues arise with the mods, please open these on the mods' issue pages if they have any (if not, good luck).

### Other notes
I speculate this is a "modding standard", but no, there's no questing book, and I don't ever plan on adding one. I don't play with quests, so I find it pointless to force you guys to play with quests as well.
